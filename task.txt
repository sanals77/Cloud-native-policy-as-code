You need to create 3–4 small experiments that:

Represent real DevOps industry situations (e.g., CI/CD, security checks, policy compliance).

Each experiment should show a scenario where:

A developer pushes code.

The code breaks a security or policy rule (non-compliant).

When the non-compliant code is pushed:

The security/policy check pipeline runs.

The results update in real time on Grafana dashboards.

Vulnerabilities or policy violations appear immediately.

You already have the infrastructure, so you only need to:

Create different test conditions (e.g., different types of policy failures).

Push code that purposely causes these failures.

Show how Grafana visualizes the issues.
